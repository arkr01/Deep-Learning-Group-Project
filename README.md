PLEASE ENSURE THE CRICSHEET DATA FILE IN /CSV_FILES IS EXTRACTED FROM ITS ZIP


---Data:
Currently just working with a tiny subset of the overall cricsheet dataset. Cleaned up the JSON data and converted to CSVs. Combined these CSVs into one very large CSV, 'cricsheet_data_partial.csv'. Also produced an overview CSV containing a row for each game in the cricsheet dataset, called 'cricsheet_data_overview.csv'. 
Currently working on converting the data to one-hot representation.
